    POLAR has first class support for the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.  
    
    Incremental reading allows you to <b>suspend and resume</b> -
    enabling you to come back at a later time and pick up where you've left off.
    
    While you're reading you can use flashcards 
    with spaced repetition to never forget anything important ever again.
    
    We've implemented the concept of a 'pagemark' *similar to a bookmark) which
    enable you to mark entire regions of a book as read and come back to it
    later.
    
    Pagemarks also allow you to sort by reading progress in the document repository
    to resume reading books based on close you are to finishing.
