- document pagemarks

    POLAR has first class support for the concept of incremental reading.  
    
    Incremental reading allows you to suspend and resume reading of material 
    and come back to it later as well as create annotations and flashcards so 
    you don't forget the material.
    
    We've implemented the concept of a 'pagemark' which is similar to a bookmark
    but you can mark entire regions of a book as read and come back to it later.
    
    Pagemarks allow you to:
    
    - sort by reading progress
    - jump around in a book marking entire sections read which you can return 
      to later
